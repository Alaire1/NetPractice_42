## IP
- **Device Identification:** IP addresses serve as identificators for devices on networks.
- **Handling Connection:** makes sending data between devices possible. 
- **Two types** currently we have two types of IPs existing, IPv4 and IPv6.
- **Private and Public IPs:** IP addresses can be also categorized as private (used within local networks) or public (used for internet communication).
- **Dynamic and Static IPs:** IP addresses can be dynamic (assigned by a DHCP server and may change over time) or static (fixed and manually assigned).
