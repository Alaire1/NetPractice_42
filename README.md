## IP
- **Unique Assignment:** Each device on a network must have a unique IP address to ensure accurate data routing and device identification.
- **Handling Connection:** makes sending data between devices possible. 
- **Two types** currently we have two types of IPs existing, IPv4 and IPv6.
- **Private and Public IPs:** IP addresses can be also categorized as private (used within local networks) or public (used for internet communication).
- **Dynamic and Static IPs:** IP addresses can be dynamic (assigned by a DHCP server and may change over time) or static (fixed and manually assigned).
- **Network Troubleshooting:** IP addresses are essential for diagnosing network issues through tools like ping and traceroute.
- **IoT and IP:** The Internet of Things (IoT) relies on IP addresses for connected devices and sensors to communicate and share data over the internet.
- **Data Security:** IP addresses play a critical role in network security, helping to identify and control data traffic, including the use of firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

### IPv4 and IPv6 diffenences
  
| Feature                | IPv4                               | IPv6                           |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Address Format         | Dotted-decimal (e.g., 192.168.1.1) | Hexadecimal, colon-separated  |
| Address Length         | 32 bits (4 bytes)                  | 128 bits (16 bytes)           |
| Address Notation       | Example: 192.168.1.1               | Example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000: |
| Number of Addresses    | Approximately 4.3 billion          | Approximately 340 undecillion |
| Address Configuration  | Manual or DHCP                     | Stateless Autoconfiguration   |
| Broadcast              | Supported (limited)                | Not supported                 |
| Subnetting             | Used to create smaller networks    | Simplified subnetting         |
| Header Complexity      | Variable header lengths            | Fixed-length headers          |
| Security Features      | IPsec is optional                  | IPsec is integral to the protocol |
| Usage                  | Predominantly used                 | Increasing adoption for new networks |
